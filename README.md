Real-Time Log Analytics & Anomaly Detection Pipeline

A near-real-time log analytics and anomaly detection platform to help organizations proactively identify issues in their distributed systems.Using Python, Redis Streams, the solution processed and analyzed continuous log data with high throughput and automation.

A Regex-based classifier reduced data noise, while DBSCAN clustering and BERT + Logistic Regression models detected anomalies and unknown patterns — improving precision by 30%.

The modular, scalable design supports automated retraining, trend visualization, and alerting, enabling faster incident response and reducing downtime risks.

This project demonstrated expertise in Python data engineering, AI model integration, and reliable workflow automation — skills directly applicable to operational analytics, fraud detection, and intelligent monitoring systems.
